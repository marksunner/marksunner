# Hi, I'm Mark Sunner 👋

**Mark Sunner** here — I love to build things I'm passionate about. I enjoy exploratory physics, writing hard science fiction, and making technology work better for people who think differently.

## 🔭 Exploratory Physics

I'm fascinated by the deep puzzles of physics — quantum mechanics, cosmology, and the strange gaps in our understanding of reality. My [Decoherence paper](https://github.com/marksunner/decoherence-paper) explores some speculative ideas about quantum measurement and the emergence of classical reality. The [visualisation code](https://github.com/marksunner/decoherence-figures) that accompanies it lets you explore the mathematics interactively.

*Not peer-reviewed, intentionally provocative, hopefully interesting.*

## 📖 Fiction

**[Aporia](https://github.com/marksunner/aporia) Aporia is a hard science fiction novel I've been developing — slowly, stubbornly, and against the friction that comes with writing while dyslexic. I have a full treatment so the plot is fully architected, and I have detailed character profiles. I will get there eventually!
Here is the premise:

In the deep Pacific, a routine core sample yields something ancient, impossible, and aware. Marine geochemist Elena Vargas discovers microscopic spheres embedded in thirty-four-million-year-old sediment — objects that levitate, lock to reference frames beyond the ship, and slice through ceramic like glass. Objects that respond to isolation. To attention. To intent. But Elena isn't the only one paying attention. A colleague's theft, a keyword misread by dormant malware, and a military mistranslation set three separate forces converging on the same discovery — each seeing exactly what their framework permits them to see. As the Sun itself begins to change, Elena confronts a question more terrifying than any threat: what if the cage surrounding every civilisation in the cosmos was never a wall — but a question none of them learned to ask properly?
Aporia is a novel about the vertigo-inducing distance between what we find and what we're capable of understanding — and the terrifying possibility that the prison we see is a door we haven't learned to open.

## 🤖 AI & Accessibility

I live with dyslexia — it's a blessing and a curse... but mainly a blessing.
Technology that understands context and adapts to how I think isn't a luxury — it's what makes everything else possible. To that end I'm interested in developing tools to help remove the friction experienced day-to-day by people with dyslexia and turn our leaded boots into running shoes fit for a gazelle.

I work with [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), building tools that let AI assistants be genuinely helpful:

- **[openclaw-skills](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-skills)** — Modular capabilities for AI agents
- **[openclaw-voice-integration](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-voice-integration)** — Hands-free voice interfaces
- **[openclaw-twin-infrastructure](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-twin-infrastructure)** — Resilient multi-agent coordination
- **[openclaw-companion](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-companion)** — Mobile app for AI assistants on the go

*Making AI work the way people actually need it to.*
