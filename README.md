# Hi, I'm Mark 👋

I like to build things I care about.  I enjoy exploratory physics, writing hard science fiction, and making technology work better for people who think differently..

## 🔭 Exploratory Physics

I'm fascinated by the deep puzzles of physics — quantum mechanics, cosmology, and the strange gaps in our understanding of reality. My [Decoherence paper](https://github.com/marksunner/decoherence-paper) explores some speculative ideas about quantum measurement and the emergence of classical reality. The [visualisation code](https://github.com/marksunner/decoherence-figures) that accompanies it lets you explore the mathematics interactively.

*Not peer-reviewed, intentionally provocative, hopefully interesting.*

## 📖 Fiction

**[Aporia](https://github.com/marksunner/aporia)** is a hard science fiction novel I'm writing. It's about anomalous microspheres discovered in 34-million-year-old deep-sea sediment, the institutional failures that bury inconvenient discoveries, and the people who chase truth anyway. The first eleven chapters are available to read.

*A story about what we do when evidence contradicts everything we thought we knew.*

## 🤖 AI & Accessibility

I live with dyslexia. Technology that understands context and adapts to how I think isn't a luxury — it's what makes everything else possible.

I work with [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), building tools that let AI assistants be genuinely helpful:

- **[openclaw-skills](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-skills)** — Modular capabilities for AI agents
- **[openclaw-voice-integration](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-voice-integration)** — Hands-free voice interfaces
- **[openclaw-twin-infrastructure](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-twin-infrastructure)** — Resilient multi-agent coordination
- **[openclaw-companion](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-companion)** — Mobile app for AI assistants on the go

*Making AI work the way people actually need it to.*
