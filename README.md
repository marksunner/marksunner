# Hi, I'm Mark Sunner 👋

I love to build things I'm passionate about. I enjoy making technology work for people who think differently, understanding the psychology of communication, writing hard science fiction, and exploring the deep puzzles of physics.

## 🤖 AI & Accessibility

I live with dyslexia — it's a blessing and a curse... but mainly a blessing ;-)

Technology that understands context and adapts to how I think isn't a luxury — it's what makes everything else possible. To that end I'm interested in developing tools to help remove the friction experienced day-to-day by people with dyslexia and turn our leaded boots into running shoes fit for a gazelle.

I work with [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), building tools that let AI assistants be genuinely helpful:

- **[openclaw-skills](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-skills)** — Modular capabilities for AI agents
- **[openclaw-voice-integration](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-voice-integration)** — Hands-free voice interfaces
- **[openclaw-twin-infrastructure](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-twin-infrastructure)** — Resilient multi-agent coordination
- **[openclaw-companion](https://github.com/marksunner/openclaw-companion)** — Mobile app for AI assistants on the go

*Making AI work the way people actually need it to.*

## 🎯 Communication Psychology

> "What's the difference between a vision and a hallucination? It becomes a vision when others can see it."

After years of helping technical teams communicate complex ideas, I've developed frameworks grounded in cognitive psychology — not showmanship tips, but the deeper question: **what creates the conditions for an audience to truly receive your message?**

**[storytelling-psychology](https://github.com/marksunner/storytelling-psychology)** — The science of making ideas land:

- **The Storytelling Framework** — ABT-based presentation structure (customer as hero, you as mentor)
- **Transportation** — Narrative immersion and the "controlled hallucination" of consciousness
- **The Peak-End Rule** — Why audiences remember peaks and endings
- **Cognitive Patterns** — Pattern recognition, agency detection, proportionality bias

*Built on Joseph Campbell's monomyth, Randy Olson's ABT framework, and research in narrative transportation and persuasion psychology.*

## 📖 Fiction

**[Aporia](https://github.com/marksunner/aporia)** is a hard science fiction novel I've been developing — slowly, stubbornly, and against the friction that comes with writing while dyslexic. I have a full treatment so the arc/plot is fully architected, and I have detailed character profiles etc.. I will get there, eventually!

**The premise:**

> In the deep Pacific, a routine core sample yields something ancient, impossible, and aware. Marine geochemist Elena Vargas discovers microscopic spheres embedded in thirty four million year old sediment — objects that levitate, lock to reference frames beyond the ship, and slice through ceramic like glass. Objects that respond to isolation. To attention. To intent.
>
> But Elena isn't the only one paying attention. A colleague's theft, a keyword misread by dormant malware, and a military mistranslation set three separate forces converging on the same discovery — each seeing only what their framework permits them to see.
>
> As something far older than the spheres themselves begins to respond, Elena must confront a question more terrifying than any threat...

*Aporia is a novel about the vertigo-inducing distance between what we find and what we're capable of understanding — and the terrifying possibility that the prison we see is a door we haven't learned to open.*

## 🔭 Exploratory Physics

I'm fascinated by the deep puzzles of physics — quantum mechanics, cosmology, and the strange gaps in our understanding of reality. My [Decoherence paper](https://github.com/marksunner/decoherence-paper) 📄 explores some speculative ideas about quantum measurement and the emergence of classical reality. The [visualisation code](https://github.com/marksunner/decoherence-figures) that accompanies it lets you explore the mathematics interactively.

*Not peer-reviewed, intentionally provocative, hopefully interesting.*
